DISCUSSION NOTES 12/01
-Struct: a user defined data type
-Cannot initialize variables in struct declaration

Struct Pointers
-Pointers to structs must ahve same type as object that they're pointing to
-Dereference and access arrow -> operator is just like the . operator but it is for pointers

Structs in Memory
-A struct's members are always sequential but not necessarily contiguous
-Struct storage in memory depends on what members it has, the data type (how large it is), the order in which it is declared

Objects
-state described via attributes
-

Classes
-describes similar types of things
-Has constructors
	Types of Constructors
	-default constructor: if user does not define a constructor, the compiler creates a default constructor with no parameters
	-user defined constructor
	-copy constructor: has object reference as parameter, creates a copy of anotehr object in terms of its attribute

	Characteristics
	-same as class name
	-should be in public
	-no return type
	-can be inherited
